-- Olist E-Commerce Sales Dashboard 
--
-- Convention: each query is a named block delimited by `-- name: <name>`.
-- db.py parses this file and exposes each block as `run_query("<name>")`.
--
-- Tables available (see load_to_duckdb.py): orders, customers, order_items,
-- order_payments, order_reviews, products, sellers, geolocation,
-- category_translation.
--
-- Important schema note: `customer_id` is generated per-order in this
-- dataset (a customer gets a new one every time they order); the stable,
-- repeat-purchase-tracking identifier is `customer_unique_id` on the
-- customers table. Every retention/CLV/repeat-purchase query below joins
-- through `customer_unique_id`, not `customer_id`.
